## Get familiar with data


```{r get familiar with data}
Hotel_bookings <- read_csv("hotel_bookings.csv")

summary(Hotel_bookings)
names(Hotel_bookings)
glimpse(Hotel_bookings)
typeof(Hotel_bookings)
Hotel_bookings_df <- tibble(Hotel_bookings)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
